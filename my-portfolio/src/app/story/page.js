      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Great at: systems and structures, attention to detail, putting out fires, stepping into leadership roles when needed, being that guy to whom everyone can turn when they need to know whatâ€™s actually going on, following instructions, general competence, just sitting down and doing the damn thing, word games.</p>

      <p>Not so great at: selling myself, using buzzwords, allowing grammatical mistakes to go unremarked upon, keeping my tongue out of my cheek, accepting compliments, networking, basketball.</p>

      <h3>SKILLS</h3>
      <p>Tech Stack: Python, Django, Flask, Express.js, React, Next.js, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS </p>
      <p>Film Industry Software: Final Draft, Final Cut, Scenechronize, Movie Magic, Prodigal (Netflix)</p>
